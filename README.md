# Parkinson’s Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is a part of the CSCN8000 course assignment. The goal is to predict whether a patient is likely to have Parkinson’s disease based on voice measurements using a machine learning model.

## 📄 Project Description

We used a dataset of anonymized patient speech features from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes several signal processing measurements like jitter, shimmer, MFCCs, and wavelet features. Our model aims to assist medical professionals by providing decision support for Parkinson’s diagnosis.

## 🔧 Methods Used

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Feature Standardization  
- Class Label Mapping  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier  
- Confusion Matrix & Classification Report  
- Visualization of Input Features
